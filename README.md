# Recipe-Finder

This is a simple app that fetches recipe data from a test API provided by The Meal DB . There are no external packages to be installed because general HTML , CSS , JS is used . It can be hosted by live server in VS Code. 
The UI can be enhanced more, it is made just for basic feasibilty and experience.
Thank you!
